## Overview

This project sets up a Flask server, processes a database (`output_two.db`), and serves an HTML file (`index.html`). The server is hosted locally, and users can interact with the database via a web interface.

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up and run the Flask server:

### 1. Download the Database


### 2. Create Templates Directory

Create a `templates` folder to store your HTML file:

```bash
mkdir templates
```

### 4. Move `index.html`

Move the `index.html and maps.html` file into the `templates` directory:

```bash
mv index.html maps.html templates/
```

### 5. Install Flask

install Flask using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6. Run the Flask Server

Start the Flask server by running:

```bash
python flaskserver1.py
```

### 7. Access the Server

Open your web browser and visit the following URL:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

### 8. Search and Find Out Who They Are

Once the server is up and running, you can interact with the database and use the application to search for and find out details about individuals or items stored in the `output_two.db` database.
